The amount of evidence contained in these six documents is astonishing. It indicates that 3D printing has really reached maturityâ€”not only as a technology demonstrated by an open-source approach (Artifact 2), but also as a game-changing force in individualized treatment and global equity (Artifacts 3, 4). Critically, the institutional case study shows that it is already a mission-critical tool in large medical systems (Artifact 6). The primary point of this curation is that policy, rather than technology, is now the variable.
We now find ourselves precariously positioned. The true danger is allowing the free and rapid innovation that promotes customized care to be choked off by the crushing shroud of Intellectual Property legislation. This is not simply an abstract legal worry; it immediately impacts patient care and the technology's democratic ideals. 
The goal is simple, we need to create a new system that offers customized patient care. To accomplish this we need to not only manage a new technology, but additionally guarantee the 3D printer continues to be a tool for healing humanity rather than just for patent protection.
