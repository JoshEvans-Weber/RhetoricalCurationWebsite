This study discusses the methodology of complicated medical printing, specifically the usage of open-source CAD-CAM software for titanium meshes. Technical detail is served rhetorically to demonstrate that high-end, personalized medical equipment may be manufactured outside of expensive, proprietary ecosystems. In stark contrast to the IP conflict discussed later, the promotion of an open-source process creates a spirit of accessible, collaborative creation.
